This repository contains the scripts used to perform a **consequential environmental life cycle assessment (LCA)** study of a novel bark value chain. All the data required to reproduce the following study are included in the "data" folder. Je Jupyter notebooks are included in the folder "LCA". More information on the system studied are included in the main article and associated supplementary documents: 

**Braud, L.**, Ramazanova, L., Lebedeva, D., Muangmeesri, S., Ekener, E. and Samec, J.S., 2025. To burn or valorise bark from a pulp mill: Environmental sustainability analysis using prospective consequential life cycle assessment. *Science of The Total Environment*, 976, p.179234. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2025.179234

In addition, this reposiroty contains the scripts used to perform another case study in which the sugar extractives (or hydrophilic extractives) and pulp are further processed into functional films replacing packaging materials (e.g., kraft liner, PET, LDPE) on existing market. This case study is based on the same life cycle inventory as the publication above and adds a processing step to produce lignin containing microfibrillated cellulose coated with extractives. The Jupyter notebook to reproduce the study is included in the folder "LCA2". More information on the system studied are included in the main article and associated supplementary documents:
